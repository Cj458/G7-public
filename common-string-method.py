my_string = " Hello world!"


# print(dir(my_string))

# to access string methods, we use the dot operator


# to change string to upper case: upper()
print(my_string.upper())

# Calebjason90@gmail.com


# to lower case

# print(my_string.lower())

# email = input('Enter your email: ')
# print(email.lower())


# lower = email.lower()
# print(lower)

# replacing characters in a string
print(my_string.replace('', 'x'))


# Homework

# make a word filter that's going to filter out every occurence of the letter f and change
# it to b(f->b) then make every character upper case


# ex: friday, i was at the french vdjcvkcvkfkf -> briday, i was at the brench vdjcvkcvkbkb

# lists ->.....
